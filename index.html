<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>
  This site links researchers with the various codesets developed by the PEDSnet team for
  identifying patient cohorts, treatments or outcomes in our database.  We are making them available
  here for both potential collaborators and outside researchers whose work can benefit from what we
  have already done.
</p>

<p>
  The codesets are based on the

  <i>Common Data Model</i>

  as described

  <a href="https://github.com/PEDSnet/data_science_training/blob/master/reading_materials/session_1/ETL Conventions for use with PEDSnet CDM v3.2 OMOP V5.2.pdf">
    here
  </a>

  . The exception is the “Query Logic” group which contains R files that draw on the codesets   and
  implement other logic and   calculations.
</p>

<p>
  Usually codesets will be of the “

  <i>iccc</i>

  ” form,

  <i>integer concept_id</i>

  and three text fields:

  <i>concept_code</i>

  ,

  <i>concept_name</i>

  , and

  <i>vocabulary_id</i>

  .  Note that for labs done, the performance of the lab may be listed as a Procedure, but the
  results of the lab may be listed as a Measurement.
</p>

<p>Please contact us at [Email goes here] if you wish to:</p>
